Final group project for AM10 - Customer Personality Analysis

For our final group project, we decided to analyze the Customer Personality Analysis dataset published by Akash Patel on Kaggle. We aim to analyze the customer base based on demographic variables as well as customer specific past purchasing behavior for items and location purchased. After this initial descriptive and clustering analysis, we want to analyze the effectiveness of different marketing promotions and campaigns for the different customer cluster to allow the company to better address and communicate to their future customers. This project will not only help us to draw better inference about the existing customer but will allow the company to better target in the future, leading to a potential improvement of retention and acquisition of customer.
